1. What are the types of matrices in Prometheus?
   Counters, Gauges, Histograms, and Summaries.
Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that is widely used for monitoring applications and microservices. It is known for its efficient data model and powerful query language. Prometheus primarily works based on time-series data, which are stored as metrics. These metrics can be classified into several types, including:
	
	- Counter: A monotonically increasing value that resets when the process restarts. It is often used to count the number of events or occurrences, such as the number of requests 		served.
	- Gauge: A value that can go up and down. It is typically used to represent values that can fluctuate, such as current CPU usage, memory usage, or the number of items in a queue.
	- Histogram: A series of buckets that represent the distribution of values in a set of samples. Histograms are used to track and record the distribution of values in a stream of 		data, such as request durations or response sizes.
	- Summary: Similar to a histogram, a summary also tracks the distribution of values in a stream of data. However, it provides a more accurate representation of the distribution's 		quantiles over time, making it useful for tracking percentiles of request durations, for instance.

2. What is Prometheus?
   - Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system designed for collecting and storing time series data, 
   allowing to monitor various aspects of applications and infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What is Grafana?
   - Grafana is a multi-platform open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of graphs in Grafana:
	Time series graphs, Bar charts, Pie charts, Heatmaps, Histograms, Geomaps, Flame graphs, Gauge charts, Table visualizations, Custom graph, types (using the panel editor)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. How does Prometheus collect data from target systems
	Prometheus collects data by scraping metrics from target systems.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. what is the role of exporters?
	Exporters are specialized agents or services that expose metrics in a format Prometheus can understand. 
	They are used to gather data from different applications and systems.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is the PromQL query language, and how is it used for data analysis in Prometheus?
	PromQL is a query language used to query and analyze time series data in Prometheus. 
	It allows you to perform various operations like aggregation, filtering, and transformation on metrics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. What is alerting in Prometheus, and how does it work?
	Alerting in Prometheus allows you to define alert rules based on metric conditions. 
	When a rule's condition is met, an alert is triggered. Prometheus can send alerts to alert manager systems for notification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. How does Prometheus ensure high availability and scalability for monitoring?
	Prometheus can be configured in a high-availability setup using multiple instances. 
	It uses a shared storage system for data retention. For scalability, it supports federation and remote storage integrations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Explain the concept of panels in Grafana and some common types of panels used in dashboards.
	Panels in Grafana are visual components that display data. Common panel types include Graph, Singlestat, Table, and Text. 
	Each type has specific use cases and configuration options.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How can Grafana dashboards be used to monitor and troubleshoot issues in your infrastructure?
	Grafana dashboards provide real-time and historical data visualizations, making it easier to monitor infrastructure 
	and troubleshoot issues by quickly identifying anomalies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. What are variables in Grafana, and how do they enhance dashboard flexibility?
	Variables in Grafana are placeholders that allow dynamic dashboard creation. 
	They can filter data and modify queries, providing flexibility and interactivity in dashboards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. How are alerts set up in Grafana, and what notification channels are supported for alerting?
	Alerts in Grafana are configured on specific panels. When conditions are met, 
	Grafana can trigger alerts and send notifications through various channels like email, Slack, or other integrations.

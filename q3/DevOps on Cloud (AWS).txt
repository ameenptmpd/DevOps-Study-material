What is a cloud service provider?
It  is an IT company that provides on-demand, scalable computing resources like computing power, data storage, or applications over the internet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Security Group:
   - A security group is a fundamental component of network security in Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
   It acts as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to Amazon EC2 instances or other AWS resources. 
   Security groups are associated with instances and control the traffic allowed or denied based on defined rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. S3 Bucket:
   - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service provided by AWS. An S3 bucket is a container for storing objects (files or data) in S3. 
   It acts as the root of the storage structure and has a globally unique name within the AWS S3 namespace.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Storage Classes in S3 Bucket:
   - Amazon S3 offers various storage classes, including 
	Standard
	Intelligent-Tiering
	One Zone-IA, 
	Glacier
	Deep Archive. 
Each class has different characteristics, performance, and costs, allowing to choose the right one for our data's lifecycle.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Types of EC2 Instances:
   - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offers a wide range of instance types, including 
	   general-purpose
	   compute-optimized 
	   memory-optimized
	   storage-optimized
	   GPU instances. 
   The specific types and performance characteristics may change over time as AWS introduces new instance families and generations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Internet Gateway:
   - An Internet Gateway in AWS is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available component 
   that allows communication between instances in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the internet. 
   It serves as a bridge between your VPC and the public internet, enabling instances to access and be accessed from the internet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. post cutting and post managment issue in cloud DevOps
 Post-Cutting Issues:
   Post-cutting refers to a phase after a migration to the cloud. 
    Issues may include:
	- Cost Overruns: Ensuring cost controls post-migration.
	- Security: Continued focus on cloud security and compliance.
	- Performance: Monitoring and optimizing cloud resource usage.
   Post-Management Issues:
     Post-management involves ongoing cloud DevOps. 
      Common issues include:
	- Automation: Ensuring automation continues to work as infrastructure evolves.
	- Change Management: Managing changes to cloud resources.
	- Optimization: Continuously optimizing resource usage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. IAM 
ans:IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a crucial service in AWS that allows you to control and manage access to AWS resources. 
	It involves creating and managing users, groups, and roles, each with associated permissions.

ans:In the context of cloud computing, "instance types" refer to predefined configurations of virtual machines offered by cloud providers
	like Amazon Web Services (AWS). These configurations specify the amount of CPU, memory, storage, and other resources allocated to 	a virtual machine instance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. AMI
ans:AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. In AWS, an AMI is a pre-configured virtual machine image used as a template for creating EC2 instances. 
	It includes the operating system, application server, and any additional software required to run applications on an instance.

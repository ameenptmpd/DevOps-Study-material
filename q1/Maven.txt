1. Advantages of Maven:
	- Simplified dependency management
	- Consistent and automated build process
	- Standardization of project structure
	- Extensive plugin ecosystem
	- Facilitation of reproducible builds
	- Seamless integration with CI/CD tools
	- Customization and extensibility opportunities

2. Maven commands
	Maven is a powerful build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies and standardizes the build process, manages project dependencies, and provides a uniform build system. Below are some commonly used Maven commands:
		- `mvn clean`: Cleans the project by deleting the target directory and removing all compiled class files and resources.
		- `mvn compile`: Compiles the source code of the project.
		- `mvn test`: Runs the unit tests for the project.
		- `mvn package`: Packages the compiled code of the project into a distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.
		- `mvn install`: Installs the project's package into the local repository, making it available for other projects that need to use it as a dependency.
		- `mvn deploy`: Deploys the built artifact to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
		- `mvn site`: Generates the project's website documentation.
		- `mvn archetype:generate`: Generates a new project from an existing template, known as an archetype.
		- `mvn dependency:tree`: Displays the project's dependency tree.
		- `mvn help`: Displays help information on Maven commands and options.

3. mvn package
	This is a Maven build lifecycle phase, specifically the package phase. When you run mvn package, Maven will execute all phases up to and including the package phase. In this phase, Maven will create the JAR or WAR file of your project based on the configuration in the project's POM (Project Object Model) file. This does not include the installation of the artifact into the local repository or a remote repository.

4. The POM (Project Object Model)file
	Essential configuration file used in Apache Maven-based projects. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details to build the project. The POM file provides details about the project's structure, dependencies, build settings, and other essential information required for Maven to build the project correctly.

5. key components of POM.xml
	Project information : This includes the project's group ID, artifact ID, version, and other descriptive information.
	Dependencies : These are the external libraries or modules required by the project.
	Build settings : This includes information about plugins, goals, and other configurations for building the project.
	Repositories : These are the locations where Maven can look for dependencies needed to build the project.

6. The Maven build and Maven package
	The Maven build and Maven package commands are both used in the context of building and packaging a Maven project, but they serve different purposes:
	Maven Build Command: 
		The mvn build command is a generic command that is used to build the project. It triggers the default lifecycle up to the package phase. This means it will compile the source code, run any tests, and package the compiled code into a JAR, WAR, or any other format defined in the project configuration.
	Maven Package Command:
		The mvn package command is specifically used to execute the package phase of the Maven build lifecycle. This phase is responsible for taking the compiled code and packaging it into its distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file, depending on the type of the project.

In summary, while the mvn build command is more generic and triggers the build process up to the package phase, the mvn package command specifically executes the package phase to create the distributable package as defined by the project configuration.**

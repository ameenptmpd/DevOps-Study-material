1. What is Java?
ans:Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its 
	platform independence, robustness, and extensive ecosystem. 
	It was designed to be portable, secure, and easy to maintain. 
	Java applications run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
	allowing them to be executed on various platforms without modification.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concept?
ans:OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to structure and model data and behavior in code.
	Key OOP concepts include:
	- Encapsulation: Hiding the internal details of an object and exposing a public interface.
	- Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes 		and methods.
	- Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common 			superclass, allowing for flexibility in method implementation.
	- Abstraction: Defining the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details.
	- class , object

3. what is an Object 
ans: an object is an instance of a class. It is a runtime entity that represents a real-world entity, concept, or data. 
	Objects have attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) defined by the class from which they are instantiated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. what is Class
ans:class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
	It defines the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. 
	Classes are the foundation of object-oriented programming, enabling the creation of objects with well-defined structures and functionality.

5. Python and java diff
ans:- Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language known for its simplicity and readability, 
	  while Java is a statically typed, compiled language.
	  
	- Python emphasizes code readability and brevity, making it popular for scripting and web development, 
	  while Java is often used for enterprise-level applications.
	  
	- Python uses indentation for code blocks, 
	  while Java uses curly braces.
	  
	- Python has automatic memory management, 
	  while in Java, you need to handle memory manually.
	  
	- Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, 
	  while Java has a strong focus on platform independence and performance.

6. what is METHOD overloading
ans:Method overloading in programming allows multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. what is method Overriding
ans:Method overriding is when a subclass provides its own implementation for a method inherited from its superclass. 
	This allows customization of behavior while maintaining the same method name, return type, and parameters.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. What is Polymorphism?
ans:Polymorphism is an OOP concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
	It enables the same method name to behave differently in different classes. 
	There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. What is a String?
ans:A string is a data type used in programming to represent a sequence of characters. 
	In most programming languages, strings are enclosed in double or single quotes. 
	They are commonly used for storing and manipulating text data. String operations may include concatenation (combining strings), 	searching, and manipulation.

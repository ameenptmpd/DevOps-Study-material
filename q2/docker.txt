1. Explain about Docker
	Docker is a containerization platform that allows to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers. These containers can run consistently across various environments, making it easier to deploy and manage applications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is Dockerfile
	A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, adds 	files and configuration, and sets up the environment for the application to run within a Docker container.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What is Docker entry file or entry point
entry file" or "entry point" refers to the initial executable that runs when a Docker container is started. It's specified in the Dockerfile to define what command or script should be executed when the container starts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Docker network types 

Bridge Network: Default for communication between containers.
Host Network: Shares host network interface.
Overlay Network: Multi-host communication in a Docker swarm.
Macvlan Network: Containers appear as unique devices on the network.
None Network: Isolated network with no connectivity.
Custom User-Defined Networks: Customized networks for specific use cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Docker CMD
	In a Dockerfile, the CMD instruction defines the default command and arguments to run when a container starts. It specifies the main executable for the container.
	This default command can be overridden when run the container by providing a new command. So, while the CMD sets the default behavior, we can change it when starting the container.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Explain about Docker image and container
	- Docker Image: A Docker image is a snapshot of a file system that contains an application and 	all its dependencies. Images are used as templates to create Docker containers.
	
	- Docker Container: A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It is isolated 	from the host system and runs the application in an isolated environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What is Docker create
	docker create is a command that creates a new container from an image but does not start it. This command prepares a container 	based on an image, and we can later start it using docker start.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Diff b/w docker build & docker create
	docker build is used to build a new Docker image from a Dockerfile, which is a script that 	defines the image's configuration.
	docker create is used to create a new container from an existing Docker image but doesn't start 	it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What is Docker Hub
	Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker that allows users to store, 	share, and distribute Docker images. 	It is a central repository for finding and sharing 	container images.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What is Docker image
	A Docker image is a snapshot of a file system that contains an application and its dependencies, along with instructions on how to 	run the application. Images serve as templates for creating Docker containers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is Docker container
	A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It is an isolated environment that runs an application and its 	dependencies, ensuring consistency and portability across different systems.
